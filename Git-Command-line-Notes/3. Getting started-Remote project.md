# Getting Started

Two Scenarios
* Local project that you want to track using Git
* Existing remote project that you want to start developing on

# Remote Project

## 1. Cloning a remote repo

```bash
git clone <remote repo url> <local dir to clone repo>

git clone <local repo path> <local dir to clone repo>
```

### View info about remote repo

```bash
git branch -a # list all branches of the repo
git remote -v # location of the repo
```

## 2. Pushing changes

### Commit changes
```bash
git diff
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### Push
```bash
git pull origin master # pull changes from remote repo
git push origin master # push changes to remote repo
```

# Common Workflow

## 1. Create a branch for desired feature

```bash
git branch feature-branch # create a new branch
gti checkout feature-branch # switch to a branch
```
> Use `git branch` to check which branch you are on  
> Make changes in feature branch and comnit

## 2. Push branch to remote

```bash
git push -u origin feature-branch 
# -u associates local feature-branch to remote feature-branch
# -u only required for the initial push

git pull
git push
```

## 3. Merge a branch

```bash
git checkout master # switch to master branch
git pull origin master
git branch --merged # check merged branches

git merge feature-branch # merge feature-branch with master

git push origin master
```

## 4. Delete a branch

```bash
git branch --merged

git branch -d feature-branch # -d deletes a local branch

git branch origin --delete feature-branch # delete the remote branch

git branch -a
```

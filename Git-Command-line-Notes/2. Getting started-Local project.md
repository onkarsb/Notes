# Getting Started

Two Scenarios
* Local project that you want to track using Git
* Existing remote project that you want to start developing on

# Local Project

## 1. Initialize a repository from existing code

```bash
git init
```

## 2. Status
Before first commit check status of files in repo

```bash
git status
```
It will show a list of **untracked files**  

## 3. Add .gitignore file
Files that we don't want to be tracked should be added to *.gitignore* file

> Untracked and modified files are presesnt in *Working directory*  
 and can be checked using `git status`

## 4. Staging area
Staging area is where we choose files that we need to commit

### Add files to Staging area
```bash
git add <filename 1> <filename 2> # Add files to staging area
git add . # Add all files in the directory
git add *.txt # Add all files ending with .txt
``` 

> Check `git status` to see the added files and changes to be committed

### Remove files from Staging area

```bash
git reset <filename 1> # Remove file from staging area
gti reset # Remove all files from staging area
```

## 5. Commit

```bash
git commit # Commit and add a long message using a text editor

git commit -m "Initial commit" # Commit and add a short message
```

### Log
```bash
git log # shows commit hash, author name and email, date and message
```
